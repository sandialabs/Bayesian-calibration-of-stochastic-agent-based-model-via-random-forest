# Advancing calibration for stochastic agent-based models in epidemiology with stein variational inference and gaussian process surrogates

Reproduction of the results and plots can achieved by running `make all_surrogate` followed by `make all_calibration`.
Comparisons with previous methods and to analyze consistency of the stein calibration can be generated with `make compare`, `make self_consistency`, and `make compare_seeds`.
See `make help` or `make` for more information on individual scripts.
